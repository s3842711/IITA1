            Personal Information
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm Timothy Botuyan, a half Thai half Filipino from New Zealand who immigrated to Australia in 2010 with my parents and 2 younger brothers. At home we only speak English, though an attempt was made to teach and learn Thai. I started my primary education in New Zealand and continued it in Australia, with my secondary education taking place at East Doncaster Secondary College where I studied Computing using Visual Basic. I've learnt guitar for over a decade though much of my recent years were without a teacher, leaving me to learn by myself and look for sheet music online and taught guitar for 2 years.

        <h2>
            Interest in IT
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have found interest in game development and data science. Since I was a child I have enjoyed playing video games with my first console being a Playstation 2, mostly playing Tekken and LEGO Star Wars with my younger brother. I have ended up playing a variety of video games and have found that I enjoy strategy games and turn based combat. My love for video games sparked my interest in IT. In my senior year of primary school I used GameSalad to recreate the game Asteroids. I later went to study VCE Computing in EDSC. For my interest in data science, I have found it interesting as to how purchases can be recommended by trends in recent purchases.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came to study at RMIT due to its great reputation in Computer Science and Information Systems. In addition to going to university open days, my course counsellor also recommended RMIT for this field of study. Another reason I chose RMIT was its high employment rate. With wanting to eventually make a living, RMIT looked like a great place to study as I know that landing a job will be difficult and starting by raising my odds with choice of university seems like the way to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my studies at RMIT I hope to learn skills that will prepare me for potential jobs in the future. The skills I learn don't necessarily need to be for my favoured job, but will still help in whatever field I end up in. In terms of learning, I'll take what I can get as long as I can find stability with it. I also hope to form connections here not only to find potential business opportunities but also to make friends.
